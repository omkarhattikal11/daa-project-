    <h2>Velora is a planned coastal smart city designed to demonstrate how algorithms can improve real-world urban systems. The city combines residential areas, commercial hubs, transport routes, public services, and recreational zones into one connected layout.
Our project focuses on identifying key challenges in Velora—such as traffic flow, resource distribution, waste management, and emergency routing—and applying DAA concepts like shortest paths, greedy methods, and optimization techniques to solve them.
Velora serves as a model for how algorithmic thinking can make a city smarter, efficient, and sustainable.</h2>
    <p>Our city, Velora, is a well-planned coastal smart city designed with a balance of commercial, residential, and recreational zones. At the center lies Celestial Circle and City’s Times Square, surrounded by major landmarks such as the City Hall, City-Central Mall, schools, hospitals, and administrative services.

The western side features a vibrant beachfront area with parks, restaurants, and a convention hall that supports tourism and outdoor activities. Residential regions like the Southern Residential Area and Varghese’s Blocks are connected through smooth road networks and supported by essential services such as petrol pumps, grocery markets, and public transport.

The eastern zone includes the Water & Waste Management Area, National Highway, and Railway Track, ensuring strong connectivity for transport and logistics. Recreational locations such as the Theme Park, Indoor Soccer Stadium, and community parks provide a lively environment for citizens.

Overall, Velora is built to showcase efficient routing, sustainable planning, and smart city development — forming the foundation for our DAA-based business cases and algorithms..</p>
